I am a fifth year CS PhD student at the [University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), School of Computing
under the supervision of [Prof. Ryan Stutsman](https://rstutsman.github.io/). I am also collaborating with [Prof. Brent Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/).
My research interests are at the intersection of operating systems, networking, and distributed systems.
Particularly, my research focuses on enhancing the scalability of modern data centers through the use of emerging hardware and accelerator offloads in the post-Moore era.

Before starting my PhD, I worked with [Tanvir Ahmend Khan](https://takhandipu.github.io/) on load-time code layout optimizations of large application binaries in warehouse scale computers.

I completed my bachelor's degree from
[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/).

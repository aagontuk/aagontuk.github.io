I am a first year CS PhD student at the [University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), School of Computing
under the supervision of [Prof. Ryan Stutsman](https://rstutsman.github.io/). I am also collaborating with [Prof. Brent Stephens](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~brent/).
My research interests are at the intersection of operating systems, networking, and distributed systems.
Particularly, I am interested to use novel hardware and accelerators
to solve emerging distributed systems problems in the post-Moore era.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a voluntary research student in [Prof. Baris Kasikci's lab](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/).
I worked with [Tanivr Ahmend Khan](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~takh/) on profile guided optimizations of large application binaried
in wirehouse scale computers to reduce i-cache misses.

I completed my bachelor's degree from
[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/).

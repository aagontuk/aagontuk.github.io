		<center><h1> A Journey To Installing And Configuring A
				Minimal Debian System </h1></center>

		<h1> 1. Introduction </h1>

		<p> I am using Debian 9 for almost 7-8 months. Before
		that I was using Arch happily for over two years untill
		somehow pulseaudio broke. Did some searches and posted
		in the Arch forum but didn't get any helpful solutions.
		Eventually I got busy and couldn't manage the time to
		investigate the problem further. So a reinstall was a
		quick solution for me. After all my primary system's
		sound server broke! I mean NO SOUND!</p>

		<p> At that time I was working heavily on Raspberry Pi.
		On which I was using Raspbian lite which is a Debian
		based system for RPi. So I thought instead of installing 		 Arch again maybe I could move to Debian. We all heard
		about the super stability of Debian.
		So at least I should try.
		Also Arch Wiki is applicable for any Linux systems!
		so why not?
		So I installed the `Network Install' or `netinst'
		version of Debian 9 (codename `Stretch') which is a
		minimal installation image. Just got the base packages
		to run the system and then other packages can be fetched
		from the internet according to user's need.</p>

		<p> So I installed the system. Then configured the system
		for my need. On the way faced some issues. After some
	       	searches and some frustating moments fixed them all.
		After preparing my system I was using the system
		without almost any issue. Was really happy with Debian
		except
		one issue wich is related to keyboard layout switching.
		May be I will discuss about it in another post.</p>

		<p> Recently I changed my laptop. So I had to install the
		Debian system in my new laptop. Along the way I faced
		some issues which were actually the same issues I faced
		in my previous install. From there this document springs.
		</p>

		<h1> 2. Purpose of this document </h1>

		<h2> 2.1. Purpose </h2>

		<p> Purpose of this document is to install and prepare a
	       	minimal Debian system with all the basic features like
		a working internet connection(wired, wireless),
		a graphical user interface, sound, video, terminal, a
	        audio player, a video player, and
		some other helpful tools. And to share my experience in
		building this system.</p>
		
		<h2> 2.2. Why this document? </h2>

		<p> Over the years I have seen that when I go to build a
		minimal system, it may be Arch or Debian or CentOS or
		whatever OS I face the same sort of issues. Though it is
		fun but time consuming and can be frustating in argent
		needs. So
		this document is mostly for me so that I don't have to
		headbang in the internet every time I try to install a
		new minimal system. I can find it all in one place. I
		think it will also help others in their argent needs.
		When they need a quick Debian install and Ubuntu is
		stepping in their necessary goals or efficiency with its
		unnecessary packages. Though this document is for Debian,
		it could be help in case of other distros too as building
		a minimal system is pretty much the same accross linux
		distros. This document can be seen as a small cheatsheet
		for a installing a preparing a minimal Debian system.</p>
	
		<h1> 3. Installing And Configuring </h1>

		<h2> 3.1 Installing Debian </h2>

		<ul>
			<li><p> Created a bootable USB from Debian 9
			netinst image </p></li>

			<li><p> After booting from the USB installation
			menu came. There are two option. One is graphical
			install option where you can install Debian
			graphically.</p>

			<p> Another one is non graphical option where you
			can install Debian using a commandline text based
			interface. </p>
			
			<p> I choose second one </p></li>

			<li><p> After entering in the installation
			process, it ran some hardware detection program.
			Then asked for an internet connection.
			I connected my wifi. </p></li>

			<li><p> Then I did other installation procedures
			like partitioning my hard disk, setting root
		       	username and password, setting keyboard layout,
			locale etc. </p></li>

			<li><p> At the end of the installation procedure,
			before installing packages it prompts me for a
			mirror to add for APT, so that It can fetch
			packages from the internet. I added DhakaCom(a
			local mirror in Bangladesh) mirror. But APT
			couldn't update its package repository as for
			some unknown reason my wifi connection got
			disconnected from Debian and I couldn't find any
			way to connect it again. As a result Debian
			installed a very basic setup in my system.
			</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h2> 3.2 Configuring Debian </h2>

		<p> When I log in to the system I got a very basic setup
		as Debian couldn't install additional packages.
	  	No <code>vim</code>, No DHCP capability, Even
		<code> man </code> command wasn't there. But got some
		useful tools like:</p>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li><p>
			<code> ip </code> -  for managing network
			configuration.
			</p></li>

			<li><p>
	       		<code> wpa_supplicant </code> - for managing
			wireless network configuration.
			</li></p>

			<li><p>
			<code> nano </code> - for text editing.
			</li></p>

			<li><p>
			<code> apt </code> - for package management
			</li></p>
		</ul>

		<h3> 3.2.1 Connecting to the Internet </h3>

		<h4> 3.2.1.1 Wired Connection </h4>

		<p> The first thing obviously is to connect the system
		to the internet. I tried to connect my system via wired
		connection. To setup wired connection I use the
		<code>ip</code> command. My wired connection uses a
		static IP.</p>

		<p> First I searched my network interface names using
		<code class="prettyprint">`ip a'</code> command. </p>

		<p> Then set my static IP address to my ethernet
		interface.
		
		<pre class="prettyprint" lang-bash>root@debian:~# ip addr add 192.168.xxx.xxx/24 dev enp7s0</pre></p>

		<p> Then added my gateway address

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# ip route add default via 192.168.xxx.xxx dev enp7s0</pre></p>

		<p> But when I was trying to add my gateway it was
		showing following error:
		
		<pre>RTNETLINK answers: Network is unreachable</pre></p>

		<p> After some searches I found several solutions but
		wasn't solving my problem. Then I realised I didn't up
		my ethernet interface before configuring all this. So I
		up my interface:

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# ip link set enp7s0 up</pre>
		
		Then set up my IP address and gateway and it worked!</p>

		<p> After that I added a DNS server. First I added only 
		my gateway. I thought It would work. But it didn't work. 
		So I added Google's public DNS server 8.8.8.8 . DNS are
		added in <code class="prettyprint">/etc/resolv.conf
		</code> file.

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# nano /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

		Then added following lines:

		<pre class="prettyprint">
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 192.168.xxx.xxx	
		</pre></p>

		<p> Now I am successfully connected to the internet! </p>

		<h4> 3.2.1.2 Wireless Connection </h4>

		<p> In the basic debian system I got <code>`wpa_supplicant'
		</code>. So I tried to connect to a wireless network
		using that.</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
root@debian:~# ip link set wlp6s0 up
root@debian:~# wpa_supplicant -B -D nl82011,wext -i wlp6s0 -c&lt;(wpa_passphrase "SSID" "PASSWORD")
		</pre>

		<p> Now wireless interface is connected to the network.
		Now I have to set IP addresses manually for the wireless
		interface as I don't have any DHCP client installed.</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
root@debian:~# ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev wlp6s0
root@debian:~# ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp6s0
		</pre>

		<p> Wireless connection worked perfectly! </p>
	
		<h4> 3.2.1.3 Automating the connection Process </h4>

		<p> Its really tedious to connect manually everytime
		you log in. So it would be easier if I can automate the connection
		process like ethernet automatically get connected when I
		plugged in or wifi automatically get connected when the
		network is present.</p>

		<p> For ethernet interface, automation process should be
		following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><p> Enable hot plugging. Hot pluggig means
			your interface will automatically up when you will
			hook up the wire in the ethernet port, you don't
			have to manually up the interface with
			<code>`ip link set enp7s0 up'</code>
			(replace <code>`enp7s0'</code> with your interface name).
			To do this you have to add following lines to
			<code>/etc/network/interfaces</code></p>

			<pre class="prettyprint">
auto enp7s0
allow-hotplug enp7s0
			</pre>

			<p> Though I didn't have to do this. In my case may be
			another program is managing this. I am not sure
			what package but it can be <code>`dhcpcd'</code>.</p></li>

			<li><p> Next you need a DHCP client for IP management.
			I have used <code>`dhcpcd'</code> for this. Install
			<code>`dhcpcd5'</code> package for this.</p>

			<p><code>`dhcpcd'</code> assumes DHCP in all your
			interfaces by  default. So if all of your
		       	interfaces
			use DHCP you don't have to do anything. But if
			your interface uses static IP like my ethernet
			connection you have to add the IP informations
			in <code>`/etc/dhcpcd.conf'</code> file.</p>

			<pre class="prettyprint">
# replcae enp7s0 with your interface
interface enp7s0
# static IP of the interface
static ip_address=192.168.xxx.xxx
# Gateway
static routers=192.168.xxx.xxx
# Domain name servers
static domain_name_servers=192.168.xxx.xxx 8.8.8.8
			</pre>

			<p> This can be done with
			<code>`/etc/network/interfaces'</code> too.
			Its provided by default in most of the linux
			distributions for network configuration. In that
			case you have to add following lines in
			<code>`/etc/network/interfaces'.</code></p>

			<pre class="prettyprint">
iface enp7s0 inet static
	address 192.168.xxx.xxx
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.xxx.xxx
			</pre>

			<p> For domain name servers use
			<code>`/etc/resolve.conf'</code>.</p>
		</ol>

		<p> For wifi interface, automation process should be
		following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li></p> Auto start
			<code>`wpa_supplicant'</code> at
			boot and connect to the available network
			automatically. This can be done in two ways. If
			you install <code>`dhcpcd`</code> you can add
			a ``hook'' for <code>`wpa_supplicant'</code>. A
			hook file is already provided in the
			<code>`/usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks/'</code> directory
			. You just have copy the
			<code>`10-wpa_supplicant'</code> file from that
			directory to <code>`/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/
			</code>. So you can do this:</p>

			<pre class="prettyprint">
root@debian:~# ln -s /usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks/10-wpa_supplicant /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/
			</pre>

			<p> Otherwise you have to add a systemd service
			file for <code>`wpa_supplicant'</code> and enable
			it.</p>

			<p> To auto connect to the available network you
			have to add the network credentials in
			<code>`/etc/wpa_suppilcant/wpa_supplicant.conf'
			</code>. This file isn't provided by default so
			you have to create one yourself. Example:</p>

			<pre class="prettyprint">
ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1

network={
	ssid="MYSSID"
	psk="MYPASS"
}
			</pre>

			<li><p> Next you need a DHCP client for IP
			management. This process is identical to the
			ethernet interface described above</p></li>

		</ul>

		<h3> 3.2.2 Configuring APT </h3>
		
		<p> Now we will be able to fetch packages. I have added
		<a href="http://mirror.dhakacom.com/">DhakaCom</a>
		mirror which is fastets in my area. To add a mirror
	       	add following line at the start of
		<code class="prettyprint">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> .
		This example is for DhakaCom mirror:

		<pre class="prettyprint">deb http://mirror.dhakacom.com/debian stretch main contrib non-free</pre></p>

		<p> Update APT package repository:

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# apt-get update</pre></p>

		<h3> 3.2.3 Installing a Graphical User Interface </h3>

		<p> Before installing any desktop environment(GNOME, KDE
		XFCE, LXDE etc) or window manager(i3, fluxbox etx) we
		have to install a display server. I will install
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">
		X Window System</a> as the display server. To install X
		Window System we have to install
		<code>xserver-xorg</code> package and <code>xinit</code>
		package for <code>startx</code> command which will start
		the X display server.

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# apt-get install xserver-xorg xinit</pre></p>

		<p> Then I installed i3 which is my favourite window
		manager.

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# apt-get install i3</pre>

		<p> Then I entered my graphical system using
		<code>`startx'</code> command</code></p>

		<h3> 3.2.4 Installing A Terminal Program </h3>

		<p> Most of the time I use <code>gnome-terminal</code>.
		So I installed <code>gnome-terminal</code>.

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# apt-get install gnome-terminal</pre>

		But after install <code>gnome-terminal</code> wasn't
		starting. It was reporting a error wich was related to
		debus luncher. So I installed <code>dbus-x11</code>
		package and the problem solved. </p>

		<h3> 3.2.5 Audio and Audio Player </h3>

		<p> Audio works in three layers in Linux. First layer is
		the audio driver, which talk to the actual audio
		hardware. Second layer is the audio server,
		which talks to the audio driver and creates
		a common platform for different application and also
		manage sounds from different application. And the third
		layer is the application layer, application which are
		generating sounds and plays them by communicating with
		the sound server. </p>

		<p> As the audio driver I am using ALSA which is built
		into the Linux kernel. So nothing to do for audio driver.
		For a sound server I have installed
		<code>`pulseaudio'</code>. Also installed
		<code>`pavucontrol'</code> which is a graphical
		application for controlling different audio devices of
		the system via <code>`pulseaudio'</code> </p>

		<p> After installing <code>`pulseaudio'</code> and
		<code>`pavucontrol'</code> I started
		<code>`pavucontrol'</code> for controlling my audio
		devices. But it wasn't starting! The problem was I
		thought after installing <code>`pulseaudio'</code>
		it will start automatically as a background process but
		it wasn't. So I took a quick look in the man page and
		tried starting with following command:

		<pre class="prettyprint">root@debian:~# pulseaudio --start</pre>
		But it complained that it wouldn't start as
		<code>`root'</code> user, in that case I have to use
		<code>`--system'</code> option rather than
		<code>`--start'</code>. Using this option it started.</p>

		<p> But still I couldn't start <code>`pavuconrol'</code>.
		When I tried to run it, <code>`pulseaudio'</code> was
		complaining following:

		<pre class="prettyprint">W: [pulseaudio] protocol-native.c: Denied access to client with invalid authentication data.</pre>

		Then I noticed when I ran <code>`pulseaudio'</code> it
		was showing following errors:

		<pre class="prettyprint">
W: [pulseaudio] authkey.c: Failed to open cookie file '/var/lib/pulse/.config/pulse/cookie': No such file or directory
W: [pulseaudio] authkey.c: Failed to load authorization key '/var/lib/pulse/.config/pulse/cookie': No such file or directory
		</pre>

		Actually the problem was user need to be in
		<code>`pulse'</code> and <code>pulse-access</code> group
		to access certain files of <code>pulseaudio</code>. So
		I added root to these groups. Also added to audio group.

		<pre class="prettyprint">
root@debian:~# usermod -a -G audio root 
root@debian:~# usermod -a -G pulse root 
root@debian:~# usermod -a -G pulse-access root
		</pre>

		After that <code>`pavucontrol'</code> opened nicely and
		audio was working! </p>

		<p> Then I installed my favourite audio player
		<code>`clementine'</code>. It worked without any problem.
		</p>

		<h3> 3.2.6 Video and Video Player </h3>

		<p> Most of the time video works automatically in Linux
		using built in video driver. In my case built in video
		driver worked, so I didn't have to do anything. But it is
		<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/GraphicsCard#Intel">recommended</a> to remove
		<code>`xserver-xorg-video-intel'</code> driver that is
		provided with the <code>`xserver-xorg'</code> package for
		newer
		intel video cards. As my internal video card is intel.
		</p>

		<p> If your video doesn't work look following pages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/GraphicsCard">Graphics Cards Debian Wiki</li>
			<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xorg#Driver_installation">Video Driver Installation ArchWiki</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p> Then I have installed <code>`vlc'</code>.
		<code>`vlc'</code> doesn't run as root. To solve this
		problem I had to hack into <code>`vlc'</code> binary
		<code>`/usr/bin/vlc'</code> with
		a hexeditor. Just search for <code>`geteuid'</code> in
		the binary and change it to <code>`getppid'</code>.</p>

		<h3> 3.2.7 Some Other Useful Tricks </h3>

		<h4> 3.2.7.1 Changing Screen Brightness </h4>

		<p> The brightness of the screen backlight is
		adjusted by setting the power level of the
		backlight LEDs or cathodes. The power level
		can often be controlled using the ACPI kernel
		module for video. An interface to this module
		is provided via a sysfs directory at
		<code>`/sys/class/backlight/'</code>. The directory
		name for the interface actually depends on
		the video card you have. As I have internal intel
		video card the directory name is
		<code>`intel_backlight'</code>. In that
		directory there is a file named
		<code>`max_brightness'</code> which holds the value
		for maximum brightness.In my case which is 937.
		Brightness can be controlled by changing the value in
		<code>`brightness'</code> file in this directory. Like
		to make the brightness 50% of the maximum brightness
		write 468 in this file. </p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
root@debian:~# echo "450" &gt; /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/backlight
		</pre>

		<p> There is also a commandline utility
		<code>`xbacklight'</code> provided by X.
		which can be downloaded using
		<code>`apt-get install xbacklight'</code>. But when I
		ran it it showed
		<code>``No outputs have backlight property''</code> this
		error. </p>

		<p> According to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/backlight#xbacklight"> ArchWiki </a>
		I need to add following in the <code>`/etc/X11/xorg.conf'</code>
		file.</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Card0"
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
EndSection
		</pre>

		<p> But before adding this to <code>`/etc/X11/xorg.conf'</code>
		file first you have to generate the file for your
		display. To do this first log out of X. Then in
		console run following command: </p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
root@debian:~# xorg :0 -configure
		</pre>

		<p> This will create <code>`xorg.conf.new'</code>
		file in <code>`/root/'</code>. Copy this to
		<code>`/etc/X11/'</code> and rename it to
		<code>`xorg.conf'</code>. Then add above configurations.</p>

		<p> It didn't work for me. <code>`xbacklight'</code>
		continued to giving the same error.
		I don't know why.
		If you face the
		same problem and solve it please let me know. </p>
